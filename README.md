## 🤙 About

__Āina__ means *__land__* in Hawaiian. This is your land for an awesome web application.

This repo was built on `Gatsby` which includes `React`, `GraphQL`, and `Webpack`. This project uses `Sass` as the style sheet language, `Prettier` and `ESLint` as linters, `Jest` for testing, and `Yarn` for dependency management. `Normalize.css` renders element styles to be consistent and current with modern browser standards. `Husky` and `lint-staged` check files when `git add` is run.

## 📖 Contents

-   4 new directories: `components/`, `images/`, `pages/`, `styles/`, `templates/`, `utils/`
-   2 starter pages: `index`, `error`
-   4 basic components with tests: `Header`, `Footer`, `Layout`, `Metadata`
    -   Use `Layout` to build pages
    -   `Metadata` is a SEO component that uses `React-Helmet`
-   2 stylesheets: `base`, `typography`

       npm run start
    ```
3. In your editor, open the source code to start developing.
4. In your browser, view live changes: [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

## 🚀 Scripts

-   `npm run start`: `Gatsby` starts the development server, builds `.cache`, and updates `public/`: [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000)
-   `npm run build`: `Gatsby` creates the production build.
-   `npm run serve`: `Gatsby` starts the production server: `http://localhost:9000`](http://localhost:9000)
-   `npm run format`: `Prettier` checks `**/*.{js,jsx,json,md}` files.
-   `npm run sass`: `Sass` watches changes in `.scss` files to compile styles into `base.css`.
-   `npm run test`: `Jest` checks `*.test.js` files.
-   `npm run lint`: `ESLint` checks `src/`.
-   `npm run clean cache`: `Gatsby` removes files in `.cache` and `public/`. This is a destructive process so use as last resort.
-   `npm run clean yarn`: `Yarn` removes files specified in `.yarnclean`. This is a destructive process so use as last resort.
