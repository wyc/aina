<h1 align='center'>ðŸŒ± Base ðŸŒ±</h1>

## ðŸ¤” About

The base foundation for a web application created by [Vi](https://www.github.com/victoriahchang). This repo was built on Gatsby which includes `React`, `GraphQL`, `Webpack`.

**Base** uses `Sass` as the style sheet language, `Prettier` and `ESLint` as linters, and `Jest` for testing. `Normalize.css` renders element styles to be consistent and current with modern browser standards. `Husky` and `lint-staged` run after `git add`.

- 4 new directories: `components/`, `images/`, `pages/`, and `styles/`
- 2 starter pages: `index` and `error`
- 4 basic components with respective tests: `Header`, `Footer`, `Layout`, and `Metadata`
    - Use `Layout` to build pages
    - `Metadata` is a SEO component that uses `React-Helmet`
- 2 stylesheets: `base` and `typography`
